   			<h3>The treatment experience for children with craniofacial differences and their families is often complex and traumatic – but we believe it doesn’t have to be.  </h3>

   			<div class="intro-info">
   				<p style="text-align:justify" class="lead"> Each year ~200K children are born with conditions leading to growth restriction of their skull (craniosynostosis) or lower jaw (micrognathia).  Left untreated, these conditions often result in serious complications – impaired neurologic development, difficulty breathing, inability to eat – the very functions necessary for an otherwise healthy child to grow and thrive.  Not to mention, differences in appearance become severe and permanent as skeletal growth continues in unaffected areas.<br><br> Today’s treatments range from highly invasive reconstructive surgery (imagine a 6-month-old infant on the operating table for 3-4 hours losing ~40% of her total blood volume) to minimally invasive endoscopic surgery that is only curative for a small subset of patients (as in < 3-4 months old with single, sagittal suture fusion).  Fortunately, a gentler surgical technique that leverages the body’s natural ability to heal – distraction osteogenesis – is growing in popularity.</p>

         <h5>Distraction Osteogenesis</h5>
         <h1>Current treatment places enormous burden on caregivers, increases risk of complications and robs surgeons of process transparency.</h1>

         <div class="intro-info">
           <p style="text-align:justify" class="lead"> Distraction osteogenesis involves surgical placement of a device (distractor) to slowly expand an abnormal bony segment.  As the abnormal bone is expanded, new bone regenerates – gradually lengthening and reshaping the affected segment until the desired effect is achieved.<br><br> But even though the technique has widely recognized advantages for correcting conditions across the entire skeleton that lead to growth restriction or deformation, technology limitations have hindered its widespread adoption.  First, distractors are semi-buried devices that poke through the patient’s skin post-operatively, predisposing these children to a variety of complications – infection (~35%), device dislodgement (3%), increased use of pain medications, visible scarring (~16%).  Second, device expansion is typically done at home by parents, leading to treatment noncompliance (~5%) and blinding the surgeon to treatment progress – necessitating an intensive post-operative course of weekly x-rays and clinic visits.

      <div class="intro-info">
        <p style="text-align:justify" class="lead"> The Ostiio distraction system squarely addresses the chief limitations of current technology.
            <p style="text-align:justify" class="lead"> <b>1. Our distractor is fully implantable.</b> Through elimination of the external component found on all distractors today, we have the potential to reduce associated complications. </li>
            <br></br> <b>2. Our system is automated.</b> Parents and caregivers will still need to perform daily distractions, but it’s as simple as a push of a button. By removing the need for manual expansion via a screwdriver, we may reduce treatment noncompliance and alleviate parental stress.</li>
            <br></br> <b>3. We put the surgeon back in control.</b> Our data-rich system provides surgeons with the means to monitor and control treatment progress in real-time, allowing them to detect deviations from treatment protocols and address potential complications before they become irreversible or cause harm.</li>

                       <p style="text-align:justify" class="lead"> <b>Philadelphia, PA, May 11, 2021 </b> – Ostiio, LLC has been awarded follow-on support of up to $1.1 million from the Michigan-Pittsburgh-Wyss Regenerative Medicine (MPWRM) Resource Center, which was established by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research to improve clinical translation of promising tissue engineering and regenerative medicine technologies for dental, oral, and craniofacial applications.  Ostiio has received two prior grants from the MPWRM Resource Center to fund the development of Ostiio’s novel, integrated therapy to treat complex craniofacial abnormalities.  This grant, the largest Ostiio has received from the Resource Center, will allow the company to complete feasibility work, and enter the formal design control phase of product development.
“The MPWRM Resource Center has been instrumental in helping us advance our technology from the early prototyping phase into a staged, product development process.” said Jessica DesNoyer, CEO, Ostiio.  “Unlike typical grants, the Interdisciplinary Translational Project Program enables productization, allowing us to bring our life-altering technology one step closer to reality.”

                     <div class="intro-info">
                       <p style="text-align:justify" class="lead"> <b>Philadelphia, PA, August 27, 2019 </b> – Medical technology company Ostiio, LLC announced today that is has raised $520K in a Pre-Seed funding round.  The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) led the round.
The pediatric health sector has high unmet medical need but historically has received little innovation focus.  Ostiio is tackling this challenge head-on by enabling a gentler, less complication-prone approach to correct skeletal growth restrictions of the skull and face that will transform today’s complex and traumatic treatment of craniofacial defects.  Ostiio’s automated device and remote monitoring platform will simplify patient treatment experience, increase surgeon control over outcomes, and expand access to therapy by shifting care from hospital-to-home.
